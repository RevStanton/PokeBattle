# PokeBattle

This project is a simple Pokémon Battle Simulator (Mini) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to fetch Pokémon data and visualizes their base stats with Chart.js.

Currently, the project contains a basic working version that compares **Pikachu** and **Charizard**. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the chart.

Future enhancements will add dynamic Pokémon selection, images, and improved styling.
